# Computer Graphics Using WebGL
This repository is a compilation of Assignments that I have attempted for my Computer Graphics course. It consists of basic 2D and 3D rendering including object tranformations, picking, camera and lighting setup in WebGL. The following are a few snapshots of the rendering produced for the assignment.

## Run The Code
The repository code can be run by cloning the repository and running the command <code>python -m http.server</code> inside the folder. Then open http://0.0.0.0:8000/ on the browser (chrome/firefox).

## Reports
The reports present in the ./src/webGL/reports folder provides a detailed description of the implementation.

## Assignment Snapshots
